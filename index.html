            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <article>
                <p>I'm a mechanic who decided to get into the world of coding. I attended college for automotive technology. I found out that I was more interested how the vehicle's computer works.
                I decided to take a 24 week course in coding to learn how it works and, more importanly, how to write it.</p>
                <p>I'm a skilled outdoorsman, been camping since I was 5 years old. I always spend a week in the boundary waters every year. I also go hunting every year, mainly for the fellowship with family and friends (but getting a deer is good too!)
                I also snowboard and play golf in my spare time. I do play video games, games that require less quick reflexes and more problem-solving thinking. For some of them, it's very helpful to have some coding knowledge.
